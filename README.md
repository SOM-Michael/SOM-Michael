👋 Hi, I'm @SOM-Michael, your bug-fixing overlord.

👀 I'm interested in: 
- Making my code so SOLID, it requires a chisel and a diamond-tipped drill bit to change.

🌱 I'm currently learning:
- How to translate my code into emoji so non-devs understand it. (It's harder than Unicode.)
- JavaScript promises. Not to break them, though.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on:
- Projects that involve writing tests *before* the code (TDD: The Disastrous Dilemma).
- Automated coffee brewing software, because caffeine is the real build pipeline.

📫 How to reach me:
- Carrier pigeon preferred, but email is okay too.

😄 Pronouns: 
- Debug/Debugger (yes, that's a noun and a verb).

⚡ Fun fact: 
- Once wrote a recursive Fibonacci function so powerful it put my computer in a time loop.
